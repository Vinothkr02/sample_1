          <p>Filler text is text that shares some characteristics of a real written text, but is random or otherwise
            generated. It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail
            spam
            filter. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain
            arose.
            To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure
            itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
            encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized
            by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
            that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
            which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
            to
            distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being
            able
            to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.</p>

          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p> In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
            what
            we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
            owing
            to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
            repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
            of
            selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
            pains.</p>
